# Feedback-Fusion: AI-Powered Feedback Analysis and Sentiment Processing System

## Project Vision

Feedback-Fusion aims to revolutionize how organizations and businesses understand and utilize feedback from their customers, employees, and other stakeholders. By harnessing the power of sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and AI-driven insights, we provide a platform for gaining deep insights into audience sentiment and making informed, data-driven decisions for continuous improvement.

## Overview

Feedback-Fusion is a Streamlit-based application that analyzes feedback from various sources, including:

*   Amazon product reviews
*   YouTube video comments
*   Company reviews (customer and employee)

The application provides the following key features:

*   **Data Ingestion:** Supports uploading feedback data from CSV and JSON files.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Automatically classifies feedback as positive, negative, or neutral using the VADER sentiment analysis library.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares text data for analysis using techniques like lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop word removal, and lemmatization.
*   **Word Cloud Visualization:** Generates word clouds to visualize the most common terms in the feedback.
*   **TF-IDF Keyword Extraction:** Identifies key topics and themes in the feedback using TF-IDF analysis.
*   **AI-Powered Summarization:** Summarizes large sets of feedback using the Gemini Pro API.
*   **AI-Driven Recommendations:** Leverages the Gemini Pro API to generate actionable insights, such as "buy recommendations" for products or "ideal for" recommendations for specific user profiles.
*   **FAQ Generation:** Automatically identifies common questions from the feedback and generates answers using the Gemini Pro API.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Presents sentiment distributions using interactive bar charts.
*   **Clear Results Display:** Organizes feedback and analysis results in a user-friendly Streamlit interface with expanders for detailed information.
*   **Web Scraping (Amazon):** Uses Selenium to scrape reviews directly from Amazon product pages.
*   **Customization:** Users can adjust various parameters, such as the number of questions in the FAQ and sentiment filters.
